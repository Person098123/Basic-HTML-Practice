    <h1>Tameem's Hobbies</h1>
   <p>I may not have a lot of original hobbies but I will explaine to you the ones that I like to do.</p> 
   
   <h2> Video Games</h2>
<p> I play <strong>a lot</strong> of video games in my spare time and have been playing them sense I was in <strong> kindergardon.
</strong> I love playing with my siblings and friends and will play with them when I get the chance.<strong>My</strong> favorite video games of all time are:</p>

<ul><li>Rhythem Heaven Fever</li>
    <li>Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom</li>
    <li>Portal 2</li>
    <li>Super Mario Odyssey</li>
    <li>Super Mario galaxy 2</li>
    <li>Hollow Knight</li>
</ul>
<p>I also like to play a lot of <em>multiplayer</em> games with friends or family with some of the games being overcooked, super smash bros ultimate, and wii sports resort. 
I will always love video games and will never give up on it even when i turn <strong>50</strong> years old.</p> 
<h2>Reading Comics</h2>

<p>I <strong>love</strong> reading comics either they be an indie comic, big studio comic, or fan comics I will read any that finds my interest. 
I only started <strong>seriously</strong> getting into comic readings only a couple years ago but its been fun reading the comics that I have thus far. My favorite comics 
that I've reed so far from a list of most favorite to still liked are:   </p>
<ol><li>Sonic archie comics</li>
    <li>Pokemon adventures</li>
    <li>Brawl in the Family</li>
    <li>DarkHold Marvel comics</li>
    <li>Avatar the last airbender comics</li></ol>

<p>This list will change later as I read more comics or possibly manga but for now this is the my list. Some comics or manga i want to read are Tri Gun, Berserk, amazing spider man,
    and more. </p>
<h2>Watching TV Shows/Movies</h2>

<p>Shows and movies are a really fun to watch either by yourself or with friends or family and can make it more enjoyable. When I get into a show I really get into it and bing it till i'm already finished with the series. Some of the shows that I binged that I completed was the entire buu saga of Dragon Ball, the entire One Piece anime, Braking Bad, and the DC animated universe movies.
    My favorite shows that I watched either by myself or with others was Braking Bad, Venture Brothers, Kaiba, Space Dandy, and others. Other shows and movies that I wanna watch are The Serpranos, Anchors away, Broklin Nine Nine, and Steins Gate. I hope I can watch these shows soon and not forget to watch them for like the hundredth time.   </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thanks for reading! I hope I can make more complicated stuff in the future.</p>
